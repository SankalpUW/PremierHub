# PremierHub

PremierHub is a project designed to scrape match statistics for over 700 players, manipulate and present the data dynamically, and organize the data based on team, position and country. The project is divided into three main components: Backend, Frontend and Data Scraping.

You can find the frontend of the project [here](https://premier-hub-frontend.vercel.app/)
The backend isn't currently being hosted, since I couldn't find any good services to deploy it for free. I'm currently trying to setup a proxmox server on an old laptop that I can use as my server. If you want to check out a demo of the project, feel free to reach out to me at **skodande@uwaterloo.ca**
